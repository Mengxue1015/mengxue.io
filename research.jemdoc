== Overview

The ultimate goal of my research is to construct a framework for active sensing of marine environment using mobile sensor network.

The two fundamental reserach questions are (1) how to ensure that the underwater robots operation operates safely and efficiently in a dynamic marine environment with high uncertainty, and (2) how to derive optimal estimation of the marine environment from different data sources.
